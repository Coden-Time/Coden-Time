- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Coden-Time
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science and Geography
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript/CSS/HTML
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I dont really want to be reached out unless its something important or its a good opportunity, but just email me if it is important.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I dont know what to put here lol
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started programming since I was 9 yrs old using Scratch, but now I'm 12 yrs old and counting using javascript. So technically I already have 3 years of learning experience
